              <p> 
                It is the year Universal Century 0079. Mankind has moved much of its population into gigantic space colonies. Nine months ago, the group of colonies furthest from the Earth, Side 3, declared itself the Principality of Zeon and declared war on the Earth Federation. Initial fighting lasted a month with both sides losing half their respective populations. Eight months have passed since the rebellion began and both sides are at a stalemate.Three Zeon pilots, Slender, Gene, and Denim, enter Side 7 in their MS-06F Zaku II mobile suits. Their plan is to spy on the colony, but they find things almost deserted, save for a lone car driving along, and one person that is visible.
              </p>

              

              <p>
                That person is a young woman named Fraw Bow, who is running to her neighbor, Amuro Ray, accompanied by a basketball-sized green robot named Haro. Fraw finds Amuro tinkering with a microscope and informs him that there's a warship docking soon, and the whole sector is being evacuated as a result. While Amuro gets himself ready, Fraw goes outside to find their neighbor Hayato Kobayashi, who was driving the car the Zeon pilots had seen earlier. Fraw accosts Hayato for not warning Amuro, but he simply responds by bitterly commenting that if military engineers like Amuro's father hadn't come to the colony, they wouldn't need to evacuate. Amuro eventually comes out in his own car and he and Fraw drive off.
              </p>


              <p>
                Near the colony, a Federation officer is speaking about the new warship which is docking, the SCV-70 White Base. He believes that White Base, along with another secret weapon, the mobile suit RX-78-2 Gundam, will give the Federation a great advantage in the war. On board the ship, Ensign Bright Noa tells Amuro's father, Tem Ray, that they will be docking soon. Tem hopes to mass-produce the Gundam in order to finally end the war. On his Musai cruiser, located near the colony, Zeon officer Char Aznable is watching the situation with his second in command, Dren. Char knows well that the Federation has been working on the 'V Project', a large project to build mobile suits of their own intended to be more powerful than those used by Zeon. Char believes that he has just stumbled upon it.

              </div>

              <p>
                Back on the colony, Gene and Denim watch as the Federation prepares a few mobile suits to be transported. Gene breaks away, ignoring Denim's orders and fires on the suits, destroying them. In an emergency shelter, civilians, including Amuro and Fraw, feel the explosions caused by Gene's attack. Amuro goes off to find his father such that the civilians can evacuate onto the warship. Amuro drives off and comes across some Federation soldiers who are trying to get into an underground bunker. A missile fired by the Zeon mobile suits strikes next to their car and kills them. Among the shrapnel and debris that shoots out towards Amuro is a large classified book. He opens it and finds full instructions for the Federation's special mobile suit: the Gundam.
              </p>

              <p>
                Slender contacts Char, telling him about the Federation's mobile suits. Gene and Denim continue to attack the base, and the evacuees begins moving to White Base. Amuro finally finds his father, who tells him to get in White Base. Tem then runs off to find some way to load Gundam into the ship. Fraw shouts for Amuro to hurry and join her with the evacuess, but as she does, a missile strikes the crowd. She is okay, but the rest of the crowd, including her mother and grandfather have been killed in the explosion. Amuro tries to calm the devastated Fraw, and finally gets her to make a run for the spaceport before she shares their fate.
              </p>

              <p>
                Amuro knows that he must help somehow and jumps in Gundam's cockpit. Amuro looks at the manual in an attempt to try to operate it. Gene notices the movement of Gundam and Amuro fires its vulcan cannons at him. Gene recollects himself and fires, but he realizes that the Zaku's rifles have no effect. Amuro finally gets Gundam on its feet, but becomes terrified when the vulcans run out of ammo. He sits there helplessly as Gene moves in for the kill. Before Gene can do anything, Gundam grabs the front of the Zaku's head, ripping it away and slamming the suit to the ground.
              </p>

              <p>
                Amuro activates Gundam's Beam Saber and slices through the retreating Gene's Zaku, hitting it's engine. The destruction of the Zaku's engine results in a large explosion that blows a hole in the colony. This explosion takes in Tem and another engineer, sucking them into space. Knowing that he can't directly attack the Zaku's engine again, Amuro targets Denim's cockpit, killing him and making his Zaku useless. Bright gets the rest of the evacuees on White Base and sees that Amuro is the only living candidate to pilot Gundam. Char watches from his Musai and realizes how much he's underestimated the Federation's mobile suit. He then fires two missiles towards Side 7.

                Paolo Cassius, Captain of the White Base, fires on the enemy but Ryu Jose, a cadet, arrives to replace him. Missiles from Char's Musai strike and the blast results in Captain Paolo getting pelted by shrapnel. Slender makes it back to the Musai and reports to Char. Char finds his report about the mobile suit Gundam hard to believe, but decides to report to his superior officer, Admiral Dozle Zabi anyway. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Back in Side 7, Fraw is helping evacuees (specifically three orphan children) onto the White Base, when another young woman named Sayla Mass calls her to help provide medical assistance to Captain Paolo. Bright walks in and gives a damage report to the Captain. All the engineers and soldiers have been killed and White Base only has ten battle-ready personnel. A woman nearby, Mirai Yashima, states that she has piloted ships before and volunteers to pilot White Base. Back on the Musai, Char is speaking with Dozle Zabi: Admiral of Zeon's space fleet and member of the ruling Zabi Family. Dozle is quite unhappy about Char not showing up for a celebration of his own victories. Char tells him how he's been sidetracked with the discovery of the Federation's V Project. Dozle is pleased and agrees to Char's request for more supplies.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Bright and the Captain finally contact Amuro and find that he's really just a kid. Bright is angry over this and is ready to remove him, but the Captain points out that they have no one else to replace him. Sayla, Ryu, and Frau search for more survivors, when a young man named Kai Shiden runs towards the entrance to the ship by himself. Sayla slaps him for leaving everyone else behind so he could save his own hide. Sayla and Frau drive off to look for others. Meanwhile, Char and a few pilots float towards Side 7 in their space suits. They give a signal and the Musai fires, creating several holes which they use to get inside. While others on White Base see this attack, Bright grudgingly sends Gundam out at the Captain's orders to destroy the spare parts before Zeon gets a hold of them.

              </p>

              <p>
                Fraw begins to reminisce as she looks for survivors, while Sayla comes across Char. She holds him at gunpoint, and Char is taken aback when he sees something familiar about Sayla. Char removes his mask and kicks the gun out of her hand. Amuro comes across them and Char runs off. He lifts up Sayla in the Gundam's hand as she looks at Char, wondering if it was her brother. Amuro destroys the spare parts, but when the hangar holding White Base opens up, Char manages to get in. The Captain shouts for the crew to close all the hatches and give a gun to everyone who can hold one. Char flies through the hangar with his jetpack, taking pictures, but the camera it destroyed by the gunfire. He makes it out with the others. Amuro tries to fire at Char, but Gundam cannot get a lock on such a small target.
              </p>

              <p> 
                White Base prepares for battle, with Mirai, Sayla and Hayato getting used to their new positions, being trained by other wounded personnel. Char comes out in his special red-colored Zaku and fights Gundam. Char gets the upper hand for a moment, but Ryu manages to distract him with the Core Fighter. This gives Amuro enough time to destroy Slender's Zaku with his beam rifle. Char watches and is in awe at the mobile suit's power. A frightened and defeated Char retreats back to his Musai. Amuro returns to White Base and gains respect from Bright, although all he can openly do is reprimand him.

              <p> 
                White Base is now headed for Luna II, a meteor that was stabilized in orbit, and is now used as resources for colony construction. There, they plan to finally meet up with the Federation. The crew becomes worried, as Char's Musai is still following them, and they believe there will eventually be another attack. On the Musai, Char finds that he is unable to get the quality supplies he requested from Admiral Dozle, receiving only two Zakus instead of three. Bright and Mirai discuss whether the Musai is holding back because they're low on supplies, or to give the illusion that they're low on them. That's when they spot a supply ship approaching the Musai.
              </p>

              <p>
                The crew is split on whether or not to attack, so Bright calls everyone on the ship to the bridge. There, he tells everyone they can either make a run for Luna II, or attack the Musai, and that either has a 50-50 chance of success. It is put up to vote, and the majority votes for an attack. Everyone prepares to attack, and White Base pulls around 180 degrees to face the Musai. As the Papua supply ship comes up along the Musai, Amuro and Ryu, piloting the Gundam and Core Fighter respectively, sneak around behind them. They begin firing, destroying the link between the ships. The Zakus are let out, and begin engaging the Gundam and the Core Fighter. Char meets Amuro once more in his Zaku, and Char proves too fast for Amuro, getting the upper hand. Suddenly, a communication comes through to Char that White Base has begun firing on the Musai. Char tries to get to White Base, while Amuro tries to keep him away.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Kai and Hayato attempt to fire from White Base, but Ryu keeps getting in Kai's way. Bright tries to contact Ryu to tell him to get out of the way, but Ryu has disconnected communications with White Base. Char knocks Amuro around but must retreat to the Musai, which cannot fire back. Since Kai and Hayato cannot fire from White Base, Hayato suggests to Bright that they use Guntank, one of the mobile suits that made it out of Side 7. The Musai manages to get its particle cannon working, and fires on White Base, which speeds up the deployment of the Guntank. White Base's forces continue to fire on the supply ship, which is destroyed, however the crew has managed to get all the supplies out.
              </p>

              <p>
               The commander of the destroyed Papua, Gadem heads out in his Zaku I, and goes off to fight Gundam, convinced that he can destroy it despite Char's warnings. He dodges a blow from the Gundam and slams into it, but Amuro manages to quickly recover, and destroys the Zaku with Gundam's beam saber. After the resulting explosion, Bright calls everyone back, as the supply ship has been destroyed, and the White Base gets back on course to Luna II.
